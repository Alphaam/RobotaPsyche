1. AI sometimes feels like a black box, I wonder if humans are a similar mystery to AI. That is, do they understand our nature more than we understand theirs?


2. In the conversation of whether we should allow the rich to fund robotics however they choose, I wonder if accountability will be enforced if funding for robotics was restricted to money that is dedicated to some department that is financed by citizen's money. The citizens will finally have a say in how robotics proceeds and robotics advancements can be tailored to specific societal needs.

3. If multiple robots are built the same way, on the basis of conciousness, are these robots different of the same robot? 

4.For robots that are being developed using citizens' tax money, should citizens have access to their data as they are technically the citizens' property?

5. With so many tests to prove that robots have conciousness being tests that compare robots to humans to find similarity, I wonder how a human will be definied distinctly from a robot on a functional level.
