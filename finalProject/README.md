## Project Idea

# Coding curiosity
I was very inspired by a conversation we had in class about a reading that presented a robot as being curious and I started thinking about how curiosity can be coded. I am, thus, thinking about building a system that has curiosity coded into it. Alternatively, working on this will force me to have a lot of conversations about what curiosity means and how human psychology can and should be translated into code. Therefore, if I fail to develop a curious robot, I would like to write about the process, research, conversations, and findings along with the failed code and have that be my final submission. 

## Implementation 

After reflecting a lot on what curiosity is I came to the following conclusions:
-Curiosity requires selective interest on a specific thing.

-Curiosity is based on context; your surroundings influence what you are curious about.

-Curiosity can be essentialized as a series of questions about a specific thing.

-Curiosity is investigative; it is naturally followed by trying to find answers.

-Curiosity is often accompanyied by change in the way we think and act.

-Curiosity is accompanied by free will; we sometimes choose what we are curious about why we choose this can either be random or predetermined depending on whose philosophy one susbscribes to.  

After this, I think I want to build a system similar to the evolution project where when certain conditions are met by a vehicle's surroundings (the surroundings being other vehicles and other variable elements), and depending on what those conditions are, the vehicle asks questions and investigates the data about these elements to generate answers that will be outwardly reflected as a mutation of the inquisitive vehicle (what this mutation will look like is still in the works). Once this mutation happens, the vehicle will no longer ask the same questions when similar conditions happen again(because it has learned) and instead either ask different questions or become unfazed by these conditions and instead look at other conditions in its context and ask questions about that.

I want to implement free will by randomizing the focus on the vehicle but this randomness will be goverened by some conditions to adress the main logical reasoning that is the basis of the ambiguity surrounding free will and fate.

## Presentation
I am thinking of having this piece be a visual piece. Kind of like a movie made with code(?) but one in which the user has some influence on what the vehicle encounters(the robot version of playing god?)but ultimately allowing the system to make the final decisions.

## Concerns
I am concerned that my approach to curiosity and what it means is too simplistic. I will, thus, do a little more reading on the science and philosophy of curiosity.
