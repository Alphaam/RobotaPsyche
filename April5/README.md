## Thoughs from reading

1. The author defines robots as friends, compamions etc. I wonder why endearing views like these are not prosperous in conversations about robots happening even in class.
2. "To you, a robot is a robot..but you don't know them. They're a cleaner, better breed than we are." The story speaks of "getting to know" robots in a way that is beyond just their technical operation. I wonder what focuses constitute an intimate examination of a robot.
3. I've seen in many similar readings where voices from within the robotics field arguing for robots' rights seem to have some emotional attachment to robots similar to the emotional attachment Susan has with Robbie. Regardless of the motivations for these attachments, I wonder if these cause a bias in their views about the role of robots in the world and if this awareness is significant as we continue in the conversation about robots and their objectively deserved space in the world.
4. The fact that robots can have an emotional impact on humans implies that there exists the possibility of manipulation beyond the intellectual plain if robots end up having full autonomy in the future. I wonder how that awareness affects how we view the necessity to have robots have full autonomy.
5. Upon examining robots intimately (beyong circuits and hardware) and arriving at an intimate understanding of them, what view of them, intimate or more surface level, is more valid when making decisions about them and why?

## Difficulties in programming

One difficulty I faced was, at times, forgetting exactly what each step in the program was meant to do. Particularly, I didn't understand why normalizing was necessary. I understand what it does, but I have no idea why it is important. I also kept gettinga negative value of the vertical component of the velocity and I am not sure if taht is supposed to happen.
