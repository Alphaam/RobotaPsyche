## PROCESS AND DIFFICULTIES ##

For this project I decided to re-write the code from scratch while learning from Dan Shiffman and doing his assigned quizs. I did this, primarily, to build comfortability with working with OOP. It took me a while to finally get the car moving, but when I did it was very worth it.

I added an acceleration and brake feature by adding acceleration to the velocity whenever a turn key was pressed that was instructing the car to turn in the direction it was already moving. 

The difficulity I faced was with the turning. I could not figure out how to make it turn at an angle that wasn't 90 degrees. I ended up leaving the turning the way it is and am planning to ask in next class.
